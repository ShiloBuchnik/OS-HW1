1) Write ptr and Read ptr are basically the same ptr, like in C.
2) When creating a file (for example with O_CREAT), be sure to give it read-write permissions, otherwise read/write might fail

3) Note that the parser returns an array of words, *including* the command name. So arguments starts at 1,2,3.. and not at 0.
